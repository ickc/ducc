0.2.0:

- wgridder:
  - kernels are now evaluated via polynomial approximation, allowing much
    more freedom in the choice of kernel function
  - switch to 2-parameter ES kernels for better accuracy
  - unnecessary FFT calculations are skipped

- totalconvolve:
  - improved accuracy by making use of the new wgridder kernels
  - *INTERFACE CHANGE* removed method "epsilon_guess()"

- pointingprovider:
  new, experimental module for computing detector pointings from a time stream
  of satellite pointings. To be used by litebird_sim initially.
